## üìå Overview
- While dining at a crowded restaurant, I noticed that staff were overwhelmed with serving main dishes, while customers were constantly requesting minor items like water or tissues.
These small requests often caused delays.
- I developed Song‚Äôs Serving to solve this ‚Äî a simple robot system that autonomously delivers basic items to the correct table.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Functions
- Customers place requests through a web form (select table + items).

- A Flask server receives the request and queues it via a Tkinter-based desktop UI.

- Staff can confirm or cancel the request.

- Upon confirmation, an Arduino robot navigates to the selected table using line-tracing with IR sensors and intersection count.

- Communication between Flask and Arduino is handled via HC-06 Bluetooth.
